The goal of biostatUtil is to provide utility functions for date formatting, survival analysis, confusion matrices, contingency tables, and data visualization.

## Installation

You can install biostatUtil from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("TalhoukLab/biostatUtil")
```
Note that there are a few administrative tasks to perform to ensure the package can still be installed when the R version is updated.

1. Run `remotes::install_deps()` to install all dependencies (these are packages listed in the `Imports` field of `DESCRIPTION`)
2. Install remaining Bioconductor dependencies with `BiocManager::install()`
3. Run `devtools::check()` to see which packages to install from `Suggests` field of `DESCRIPTION`
4. Open Terminal and run `R CMD javareconf` to reconfigure Java paths and other configurations. Note that Java v1.8.0 is required for java dependencies to successfully load when `biostatUtil` is attached.
